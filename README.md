# AI Music Generation
# 🎵 AI Music Generation Bot  

An AI-powered music generation project that creates unique melodies using deep learning.  
Built and customized by **Mani Chandrika K**, this project explores the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **music creativity**.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎶 **Generate original music** with neural networks.  
- 🎹 Supports multiple instruments and styles.  
- ⚡ Fast training & inference on modern GPUs.  
- 📊 Visualization of generated waveforms and spectrograms.  
- 💾 Save outputs as audio files for reuse.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib, Librosa** (for audio analysis)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation
